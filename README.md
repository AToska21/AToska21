## Hi there 👋, I'm Andrea Toska. I'm a new coder and I own a server that I do random stuff with.

This is what I do:

- 🏫 I attend the school Kings Tirana, I finished Year 8 on June 16th.
- 📫 My school email is andrea.toska@kingstirana.net, but the staff use kingstirana.com domains for whatever reason.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my app, iChatbot3.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift and Java.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on creating an app.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with my new discord bot, DCGPT.
- 💬 Ask me about anything.
- 📫 How to reach me: Use my email andrea.toska@kingstirana.net OR my discord ID 507605578600808449 (you can search my current name [here](https;//discord.id))
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was in the Top 3 of the Albanian ICT Awards X!
